		   	<h3>I like to consider myself an active individual. Not a big, bulky I-live-at-the-gym type of guy. Rather, I like to explore the outdoors with my mind and body. Regardless of where I go, I am bound to discover something new. For that very reason, I enjoy the outdoors for what it offers: the opportunity to meet people, expose myself to problems and ideas, and confirm my passions.

		    Running has always a passion of mine but it wasn't until I joined the high school track team that my perspective on this activity truly changed. I was selected for the 4 x 100 m relay team, and I also participated in the 100 m dash. What I've come to realize is running isn't about the speed, setting a personal record, nor is it about the glory of winning--it's about what you can accomplish with others. Without a supportive community built on the mutual understanding teammates have developed, the trust coaches place on the athletes, and the shared passion for track and field, what good is an athlete? It's the people, whether it be family and friends, teammates or competitors, and the environment that motivates me to keep pushing myself. </p>

		    <p><span class="first-character sc"></span>If time allows, I try to run outdoors as often as I possible. In a way, being outside allows me to step out of my personal bubble and expose myself to problems relevant not only to myself but others. I like to think of jogging as an adventure or journey. It's not about the destination necessarily--sometimes it's arbitrary--but about the overall experience. Ultimately, that boils down to the people I jog with, people or things I encounter, and the sensations the environment induces. 

		    <p>Running offers me to opportunity to witness and appreciate the beauty of nature and people, encouraging me to contribute positively to society to preserve or improve it. When I listen and see, I observe and perceive problems in my surrounding. However, being able to identify problems is insufficient. Gaining empathy and compassion is the the starting line for change.</p>
		    
			<p class="margin-top-10"> 
			During my "travels," I tend to observe issues like: the number of stray animals on the streets, the environmental condition (e.g. the amount of litter, the abscense of a stop sign, the eroding of running trails), or even the living conditions of people. The more I saw, the more I felt compelled to produce change. It inspired me to narrow down my extracurricular activities to focus my volunteer work on animal welfare and children's development in education.

			 “I’ve had people tell me ‘you wouldn’t have made that call if you were a guy,'” Madison said. She added that players and coaches often test her more than they would a male referee and think they can get away with more because she is a woman. 

				<p>Randy Vogt, author of “Preventive Officiating” and columnist for Soccer America, agrees that men treat female officials differently.
