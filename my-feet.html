		   	<h3>I like to consider myself an active individual. Not a big, bulky I-live-at-the-gym type of guy. Rather, I like to explore the outdoors with my mind and body. Regardless of where I go, I am bound to discover something new. For that very reason, I enjoy the outdoors for what it offers: the opportunity to meet people, expose myself to problems and ideas, and confirm my passions.

		    Running has always an interest of mine but it wasn't until I was selected for the 4 x 100 m relay team for my high school's Track and Field team that my perspective on running changed. I've come to realize that running isn't always a race. It's not about the speed, setting a personal record, nor is it about the glory of winning--it's about what you can accomplish with others and how hard you are willing to work for it. </p>
		    <p> <span class = "first-character sc"></span>Without the supportive community built upon the mutual understanding my teammates have developed, the trust our coaches place on the athletes, and our shared passion for track and field, what good is an athlete? It's the people, whether it be family and friends, teammates or competitors, and the environment that motivates me to keep pushing myself to be better. </p>

		    <p><span class="first-character sc"></span>If time allows, I try to run outdoors as often as I possible. In a way, being outside allows me to step out of my personal bubble and expose myself to problems relevant not only to myself but others. I like to think of jogging as an adventure or journey. It's not about the destination necessarily--sometimes it's arbitrary--but about the overall experience. Ultimately, that boils down to the people I meet, problems or hurdles I encounter, and the sensations the environment provides. 
 		    <p>Running offers me to opportunity to witness and appreciate the beauty of nature and people, encouraging me to contribute positively to society to preserve or improve it.Exploring the outdoors is a way for me to engage myself with problems that exist and reflect on the steps I can take to help.</p>

			Running offers me to opportunity to witness and appreciate the beauty of both people and nature, encouraging me to contribute positively to society through preserving or improving it. Exploring the outdoors is an opportunity for me to discover the problems that exist and what steps I need to take to help. The more I see, the more I feel compelled to produce change. My runs have inspired me to narrow down my extracurricular activities and concentrate my volunteer work on animal welfare and children's education.

		    <p><span class="first-character sc"></span> Of course, not every run is like an expedition. I do not always run 5 to 7 miles nonstop. I do take the time to enjoy the air, the scenery, and reminisce the thrill of the sport that brought me here today. My passion for running is confirmed every time without fail. I appreciate the sport for allowing me to explore and appreciate the beauty the world has to offer. Every run is incredibly rewarding.</p>
